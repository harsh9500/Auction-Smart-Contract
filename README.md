Auction-Smart-Contract
The Smart Contract was deployed and tested on the Remix IDE. The solution is simple, handy and easy to use. The owner of the Smart Contracts can register bidders. Each bidder is initialized with balance tokens, which can be used for bidding. Once the balance gets exhausted, the bidder is not allowed to vote. The winner is revealed at the end of the Auction by the owner.
